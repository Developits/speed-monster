          Qustion:01) What's the Difference between Local storage and Session
          storage?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-danger">Answer:</strong>
          JavaScript provides three mechanisms for storing data on the session
          storage, and local storage. Each one has advantages and disadvantages.
          Local storage is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger
          amounts of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the
          browser is closed. Local storage is useful for storing data that the
          user will need to access later, such as offline data. Session storage
          is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current
          session. This means that the data will be deleted when the user closes
          the browser. Session storage is useful for storing data that is
          sensitive, such as login credentials.

          What's the Difference between Global scope and Block space?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-danger">Answer:</strong>
          The Global scope is a variable exists inside or outside a block. If a
          variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it
          exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by
          any line of code in the program, including inside blocks. The Block
          scope So far, we’ve seen variables defined with the var keyword. Var
          can declare a variable either in the global or local scope. The
          variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to
          local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.
          The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that
          the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a
          new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the
          variables are still in the same scope.

          How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-danger">Answer:</strong>
          The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous
          programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using
          a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
          multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.
          The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations
          in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped
          from the stack. svg viewer svg viewer The event queue is responsible
          for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
          queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all
          operations should be sent for execution. Whenever an async function is
          called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the
          browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API
          starts its own single-threaded operation. An example of this is the
          setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation is processed in the
          stack, it is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the
          specified time to send this operation back in for processing. Where
          does it send the operation? The event queue. Hence, we have a cyclic
          system for running async operations in JavaScript. The language itself
          is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act as separate threads. The
          event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or
          not the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new functions are added
          from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call is
          processed.

        <h3 class="text-primary">How many ways to find Undefined?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-danger">Answer:</strong>
          8 ways to get Undefined.Such as: <br />
          1)Any variable which is not initialized befole call will give
          undefined. <br />
          2)Creating a function without return will give undefined. <br />
          3)Any peramiter which is not passed though function will give
          undefined. <br />
          4)If return has nothing on the right sidewill give undefined. <br />
          5)Property doesn't exists on an object will give undefined. <br />
          6)Accessing array elements outside of the index range will give
          undefined. <br />
          7)Deleting an element inside an array will give undefined. <br />
          8)Set a value directly will give undefined.
